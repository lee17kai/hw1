Hello, world! This is my first homework assignment for KIEI-451. For this assignment, I created a website for my fictional business, Kai's Kakes.
The website contains a home page with an image of a cake that links to a Menu page and About us page. The menu page has a table of products and 
the About us page has a short description of my fictional business's values and philosophy. Thanks for visiting!
